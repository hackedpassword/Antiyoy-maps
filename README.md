# Antiyoy-maps
Maps based on the popular Android turn-based strategy game [Antiyoy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android), for [Unciv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unciv.app).

No assets of Antiyoy are used. Antiyoy maps are reference designs. Credit goes squarely to [yiotro](https://github.com/yiotro/Antiyoy) for creating this fine game.


## What is this?
This mod of Unciv aims to recreate the levels of Antiyoy in the flavor of Unciv.

Antiyoy is a LOT of fun. The maps, design, gameplay, are really simple, yet deeply strategic. It is a free game, ad free, supported by contributors. Unciv follows suit, being a remade clone of its commercial counterpart.

Map creators in Unciv are welcome to contribute to this mod/repo. I'll lay out how these fan-made maps should work, and you'll figure it out from there!

## Design guidelines (not rules):
1. Standard rulesets Vanilla or G&K are preferred but not mandatory. If you do build for a different ruleset, make sure to say so in the map description. More on this below.
2. Standard tileset will be Hexarealm. Same thing as above.
3. Level name should be consistent, so: [Antiyoy Lv01] will be the expected name format. Ruleset alterations should suffix [ - Rekmod] for example, looking like [Antiyoy Lv01 - Rekmod]. Note the 2 digit level number.
4. Apply resources intuitively. Very small maps likely don't need Uranium, or maybe not even Aluminum. That's up to you, but consider how cramped things are going to get in tiny worlds.
5. Try to maintain the theme layout of the original. This is part of the nostalgia of the crossover. Use different terrains to represent land differences while still staying true to the original. Map shape is your choice, I prefer hex, but might use rectangular for some.
6. Adding hills, rivers, and other Features should fit with Unciv gameplay. Remember that rivers affect certain buildings, and movement speeds.
7. Castle positions are represented with Citadels, although City Ruins or even certain Improvements might accomplish the same goal.
8. Pine trees convert to Forest, shaggy trees convert to Jungle. For conversions' sake and the mods' intent, please retain placement of the original without adding more.
9. Inner water tiles are Lake, body of water is Ocean, shorelines are Coast. I prefer one tile unit of Coast, you may like something else. Or none in some, all areas. Consider the effect on naval units.
10. When you're ready to post your map, remember to make description updates etc here also! :D

## Descriptions
There is a preview/ dir to put levelshots in. Name them same as your map. Prefer .png for its crispness, .jpg for big images.
Update the readme with details players want to know. Does this level use a different ruleset/tileset? Any special notes?

## Updates and FAQ
Q. Can I update someone else's map?

A. Modifying someone else's resource might be a bit sketch, so consider reaching out first.

Q. Well then can I remake that level?

A. I don't see why not. The level name will need to reflect being another version, so try: "Antiyoy Lv01 [ur_name]" looking like "Antiyoy Lv01 someN00b".

Q. Do you need to approve anything?

A. Nope. If a map is seriously problematic it might get pulled for reassessment, and we'll take that up in Discord.

Q. Can I post unfinished maps?

A. I suppose that will be fine for now, IF: you suffix "unfinished" or some term to the level name like "Antiyoy Lv02 unfinished". We're expecting you to get back to it. I'll pull the map if it stagnated too long. Or finish it myself. Or put it on the block for someone to pick up. Follow through!

## Have fun
Not worth doing if it's not fun. I like to have structure in my development but not too much where people are drowning in overhead. Enough to ensure good accessibility.
