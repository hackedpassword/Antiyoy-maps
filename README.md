# Antiyoy-maps re-made for Unciv!

Maps based on the popular Android turn-based strategy game [Antiyoy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android), for [Unciv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unciv.app). Definitely check out this very simple turn based hex tile strategy game.

No assets of Antiyoy are used. Antiyoy maps are reference designs. Credit goes squarely to [yiotro](https://github.com/yiotro/Antiyoy) for creating this fine game.

## What is this?
This mod of Unciv aims to recreate the levels of Antiyoy in the flavor of Unciv.

The number of citadels per map is the number of players intended, where each citadel represents a castle from the original level. Forests, jungles, lakes, forts, and territory zones are also replicated. Farms replace huts.

Uses G&K ruleset.

Current maps: **Campaign levels 1 - 3**. More to come. 

## Level 02
