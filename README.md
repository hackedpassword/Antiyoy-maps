# Antiyoy-maps re-made for Unciv!

Maps based on the popular Android turn-based strategy game [Antiyoy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android), for [Unciv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unciv.app). Definitely check out this very simple turn based hex tile strategy game.

No assets of Antiyoy are used. Antiyoy maps are reference designs. Credit goes squarely to [yiotro](https://github.com/yiotro/Antiyoy) for creating this fine game.
